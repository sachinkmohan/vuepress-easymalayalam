1. **How do I learn Malayalam from the scratch?** <br />
   This is exactly the same as learning any other language. These 2 videos by the world's best polyglots [Luca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yexczOMlTwI) and [Lydia](https://youtu.be/eT7dx52wIC8) should help you start with.

3. **I am unable to find your profile on italki**
   A: That's because I am occupied with other students and hided the profile. Please write me on Instagram to check if any slots are available. Maybe we can work something out. If nothing works out, please do check out the other teachers on italki.
