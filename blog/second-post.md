# Are you stuck while speaking Malayalam?? Try this if you just started learning Malayalam/any other language!

Before getting into the further details, I request you all to see the video by the famous polyglot Lýdia Machová. She explains the "[The Power of Setting Priorities in Language Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT7dx52wIC8)". This will give you some structure to begin with.

But those are high level things, if you are really serious about learning the language. If you have just began, then I suggest you learn basic phrases like 'hi', 'how are you?', 'Let's have tea'.

Once you can say these things, then try to develop a small conversation for 30 seconds with that target person you intend to talk, yes you heard it right - 30 seconds. For eg., let's look at the conversation below.

**Note**: The conversation is in the target language

_**You**_: Hi

_**Native Speaker(NS)**_: Hi

_**You**_: How are you?

_**NS**_: I am good and you?

Probably at this level you exhausted your knowledge in the target language. So let's push your boundaries and see the same conversation again.

_**You**_: Hi

_**Native Speaker(NS)**_: Hi

_**You**_: How are you?

_**NS**_: I am good and you?

_**You**_: How was your weekend?

_**NS**_: I was just chilling, I saw a new movie.

So now you must have seen the difference between the first and the second conversation. You added something on top of the old conversation.

Keep practicing the same conversation, make flashcards - Quizlet(quizlet.com) on the new words and phrases you just learned and practice them, so that they stay in your long term memory(LTM).
